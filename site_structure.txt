field's ( autocomplete-ish )

maybe press a plus button, and these details come up, maybe google card-like interface would be kind of interesting?
once query is made, it stays on the screen, and you can add as many as you want to the screen

department:
i.e. CS

course:
i.e. 150

* potential addition here, if we want to scrape the course catalog we could let people search by course name instead

professor
maybe show picture preview along with gpa and teaching rating preview in the autocomplete field?
- would involve scraping professor pictures from lafayette site too


date range:
slider would probably be best for this


RESULTS (added to page):

professor name
class
effectiveness mean along with a graph
grade mean along with a graph



----------- FUN FACTS ------------

the stuff from processor.py (hardest professor stuff etc), might not be worth focussing on this until we have the compare part working, feels like just a fun extra feature, not important to get out before course selection
